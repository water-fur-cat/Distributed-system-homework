## homework 1: 
### Description:
In this assignment, I create a client/server system that exchanges information between a single 
client and a single server.  <br>
The project is implemented in Python 3 and use the standard Python socket and pickle libraries.  <br>
The project is organized in two parts. In the first part, I set up a client/server to exchange text 
messages; in the second part I extend the client/server to exchange Python objects. 
<br>

### Functionality: 
1. Client able to connect to server 
2. Server able to receive message 
3. Server able to respond to message 
4. Method to serialize Python object 
5. Client/server able to exchange Python objects <br>

## homework 2:
### Description:
In this assignment, students will learn to work with Docker, which is a popular virtualization technology. They
will develop an application which will be run in Docker containers. <br>
In this part, we deploy a classifier model for the MNIST dataset (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/
mnist/) in a Docker container. The code to train and use the model (using Tensorflow) is already provided as two Python files (train.py and classify.py). It also provided a set of test images (images.tar.gz) to test classifier. <br>

### Functionality: 
1. Dockerfile correctly defines image with files and dependencies as specified (10 points)
2. build.sh builds Docker image correctly (5 points)
3. run.sh runs Docker container correctly and persistently with a shared mount (15 points)
4. infer.sh runs inference correctly by communicating with Docker container (10 points)
5. README conceptual questions (5 points per question)

## homework 3:
When a user taps on a table cell the following sequence of events should happen: <br>
1. The FavoritesViewController should send the information about the tapped cell to the MapViewController using a custom protocol and delegate. <br>
2. The FavoritesViewController should dismiss itself.  <br>
3. When the MapViewController appears, the map's region should animate to highlight the favorite place.  <br>
4. The map view's HUD display view should should the information for the selected favorite place.  <br>
